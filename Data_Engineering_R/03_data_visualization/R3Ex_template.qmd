# Joining baseball data

Use the data from the `{Lahman}` package. [A description of the package is available at CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lahman/Lahman.pdf)

## Players with 300 home-runs and 300 stolen bases (3P)

Name every player in baseball history who has accumulated at least 300 home runs (HR) and at least 300 stolen bases (SB). 
(Use the `Batting`, and `People` data from the `Lahman` package).


```{r}

```


## Players with 50 home-runs in 3 different years (3P)

Name every player in baseball history who has scored 50 home runs in at least 3 different years.
(Use the `Batting`, and `People` data from the `Lahman` package).

```{r}

```

## Teams with the highest number of home-runs per player (3P)

Identify the names of the 5 teams in baseball history with the highest number of home runs per player.
(Use the `Batting`, and `Teams` data from the `Lahman` package).

```{r}

```



# Joining fligths data  

Use the `{nycflights13}` package to answer the following questions. [A description of the package is available at CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf).

## How many different planes? (5P)

Use the `flights` and `planes` tables (in the `{nycflights13}` package) to answer the following questions. 

### Primary keys

* Does `planes` table have a primary key? 
* Can you identify a primary key in `planes` table? 
* Show that `tailnum` is not a primary key in `flights` table. 
* How many different planes departed from "JFK" in 2013?

### Join tables the flight and planes tables.

Use and compare inner/right/left/full join to combine the `flights` data with the `planes` data. 

* How many of the planes in the planes table departed from "JFK" in 2013? 
* Have planes departed from "JFK" that are not in the planes table?
* How many of the different ***planes in the `planes` table*** flew from New York City in 2013? 
* Which join commands yield correct/wrong results and why? 

***Inner Join***

```{r}

```

***Right Join***

```{r}

```

***Left Join***

```{r}

```

***Full Join***

```{r}

```






## The oldest plane that departed from New York Airport (3P)

What is the oldest plane (specified by the `tailnum` variable) that flew from New York City airports in 2013? Use the `flights` and `planes` tables (in the `nycflights13` package). Rename `year` in `planes` to `plane_year` to avoid collision with `year` in `flights`. 
```{r}

```

# Grammer of Graphics

## Analysis of a graph (4P)
Analyze the following graphical data presentation by considering the following points:

  a. Identify the visual cues, coordinate system, and scale(s).
  b. How many variables are depicted in the graph? 
  c. Explicitly link each variable to a visual cue that you listed above.
  d. Critique this data graphic using the taxonomy described in lecture slides.

\newpage
## Improve a graphical data presentation (4P)
Analyze the following graph by considering the following points:

 a. Critically assess the designer's choices for the graphical data presentation. 
 b. Suggest improvements for the graph.
