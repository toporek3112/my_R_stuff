# Visualise `RailTrail` data

Use the `mosaicData::RailTrail` data set from the `{mosaicData}` package. [See for a description of the data]( https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mosaicData/versions/0.17.0/topics/RailTrail). According to [Cambridge.org](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/rail-trail) is a rail-trail a path for walking or bicycle riding, created from a railway that is no longer used by trains. 

```{r}
railtrail <- as.tibble(RailTrail)
glimpse(railtrail)
```

## Scatterplot (2P)

Create a scatterplot of the number of crossings per day, `volume`, against the high temperature, `hightemp`, of that day. Use  a header and legends appropriately and interpret the resulting graph.

```{r}
p <-  ggplot(railtrail, aes(x = volume, y = hightemp)) +
      geom_point(aes(col = hightemp, size = volume)) +
      ggtitle("Correlation between temperature and 'Number of crossings per day'") +
      xlab("Number of Crossings") +
      ylab("High Temperature (°F)")
p
```
A: The graph shows a correlation between temperature and 'Number of crossing per day'. Overall there are more 'Number of crossings per day' when the temperature is above 60F°.

## Separate scatterplots during week and weekend  (2P)

Separate the above scatter plot into facets by weekday. Use  a header and legends appropriately and interpret the resulting graph.

```{r}
p <- p +  facet_wrap(~weekday, 
                     labeller = labeller(
                       weekday = 
                         c(`TRUE` = "Weekend/Holiday", `FALSE` = "Weekday"))) +
          labs(subtitle = "Divided by Weekdays and Weekend/Holidays")
p
```
A: Overall there are more occurences on Weekends/Holidays. The graph also shows that there are more 'Number of crossings per day' even in temperatures beneath 60F°.

## Add regression lines (2P)

Add  regression lines to the two facets. Show the results for linear and nonlinear regression lines. Use a header and legends appropriately and interpret the resulting graphs.

### Linear Regression Line

```{r }
p +  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Nonlinear Regression Line

```{r}
p +  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

A: The regression lines show that there is indeed a preference to go for a walk/bicycling when the temperature is higher.


# Visualise `mtcars` data

Use the `mtcars` data. A [description of the data is available](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars). 

First transform the variables in the `mtcars` data into European measures and then graph the data as requested in the following.

## Transform `mtcars` into European measures (3P)

For the transformation into European measures consider that   

   - `1 mile = 1.609 km`
   - `1 gallon = 3.785 liter`
   - `1 liter = 61.0237 cu.in`
   - `1 kg = 2.20462 lbs`

Create the following variables:

 - transform `mpg` into `verbrauch` as measure for the fuel consumption in `liter` per `100 km`.
 - rename `cyl` into `zylinder` as number of cylinders.
 - transform `disp` into `hubraum` as the size of the engine measured in liters.
 - transform `qseq` into `beschleunigung` to measure the seconds it takes to accelerate to `100 km/h`. `qseq` are the seconds it takes to travel `1/4` mile. For the transformation assume a __constant acceleration__ (__constant increase of the speed__) until the car reaches `1/4` mile. The speed starts at zero and the final speed at `1/4` mile is twice the average speed (as measured  by traveling a `1/4` mile in `qsec`). 
 - rename `drat` into `drehmoment`
 - transform `wt` (1000 lbs) into `gewicht` (1000 kg).
 - transform `am` into `schaltung` as `Automatik` for `am = 0` and `Manuell` for `am = 1`
 - transform `vs` into `motor` as `V-Motor` for `vs = 0` and `Reihenmotor` for `vs = 1`

```{r}
mtcars$car_names <- rownames(mtcars)
mtcars$verbrauch <- (100 / (mtcars$mpg * 1.609)) * 3.785
mtcars$zylinder <- mtcars$cyl
mtcars$hubraum <- mtcars$disp / 61.0237 

distance_km <- 0.25 * 1.609
mtcars$beschleunigung <- (100 / ((2 * distance_km) / (mtcars$qsec / 3600)))

mtcars$drehmoment <- mtcars$drat
mtcars$gewicht <- mtcars$wt / 2.20462
mtcars$schaltung <- ifelse(mtcars$am == 0, "Automatik", "Manuell") 
mtcars$motor <- ifelse(mtcars$vs == 0, "V-Motor", "Reihenmotor")
glimpse(mtcars)
```

## Graph `verbrauch` as determined by `hubraum` (2P)

Explain the variable `verbrauch` through `hubraum` in a scatter plot. Include `hp` and `beschleunigung` as determinants of the variable `verbrauch` through the color and size of the data points in the scatter plot, respectively. The resulting graph should look like this:


```{r }
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hubraum, y = verbrauch, color = hp, size = beschleunigung)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") + 
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Fuel Consumption and Engine Size",
    x = "Engine Size (Liters)",
    y = "Fuel Consumption (L/100km)",
    color = "Horsepower",
    size = "Acceleration (0-100 km/h in seconds)"
  )


p2

ggsave("Exercise_cars_verbrauch_hubraum.png")
```

## Interpret the graph (2P)

What does the graph reveal about the relation between the different variables in the data set?

```{r eval=FALSE}
The graph shows: 
A positive correlation between engine size and Fuel consumation. 
Cars with bigger engines use more fuel per 100km.
Also, bigger engines tend to have more horsepower but this 
does not necessary mean a faster acceleration. 
```

## Automatic versus Manual (2P)

Show the above graph for cars with automatic and manual gear shifting and interpret the resulting graph.

```{r}
p2 + facet_wrap(~schaltung)
#g
ggsave("Exercise_cars_facet_am.png")
```

<!-- ![](Exercise_cars_facet_am.png) -->


```{r eval=F}
Interpretation of the graph:
Interestingly the face wrap reveals that cars with a manual gear switching mechanism 
use less fuel then automatic gear shifting and also tent to have bigger engines. 
Which explains the higher fuel consumtiom as we have seen before 
--> bigger engin --> more fuel consumtion
```



## Show cars with very high fuel consumption (1P)
Show the names of the cars (together with `verbrauch`, `hubraum`, `beschleunigung`, `hp` and `gewicht`) that have more than 20 liters of fuel consumption per 100 km (in the graph at the top right corner) or an engine size of more than 7 liters.

```{r}
mtcars[
  (mtcars$verbrauch > 20 | mtcars$hubraum > 7), 
  c("verbrauch", "hubraum", "beschleunigung", "hp", "gewicht")
]
```


## Show cars with very high acceleration (1P)

Show the names of the cars (together with `verbrauch`, `hubraum`, `beschleunigung`, `hp` and `gewicht`) that have a `beschleunigung` of less than 7.5 seconds. 

```{r}
head(mtcars[
  (mtcars$beschleunigung < 7.5), 
  c("verbrauch", "hubraum", "beschleunigung", "hp", "gewicht")
])
```


```{r}
## Insert a table into a graph
library(ggpmisc) 
df <- mtcars %>% filter(hubraum >= 7 | verbrauch >= 20 ) %>% 
  select(c('car_names','verbrauch','hubraum')) %>% 
  mutate(across(2:3, round, 1))
p2 + geom_table(aes(x=1.1, y=23, label=list(df)))
```



# Visualise dietary data

Use the code `data("UScereal", package = "MASS")` for the `UScereal` data from the `MASS` package. See https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MASS/versions/7.3-53/topics/UScereal for details. Adjust the
Manufacturer in `mfr` (represented by its first initial): G=General Mills, K=Kelloggs, N=Nabisco, P=Post, Q=Quaker Oats, R=Ralston Purina and the display shelf in `shelf` (1, 2, or 3, counting from the floor) into  `bottom-shelf`, `middle-shelf` and `top-shelf`. 
```{r warning=T, message=T}
#library(MASS)  # überschreibt select() in dplyr package ---> do not use library(MASS)   
data("UScereal", package = "MASS") # überschreibt select NICHT
UScereal <- UScereal %>%
  mutate(
    mfr = case_when(
      mfr == "G" ~ "General Mills",
      mfr == "K" ~ "Kelloggs",
      mfr == "N" ~ "Nabisco",
      mfr == "P" ~ "Post",
      mfr == "Q" ~ "Quaker Oats",
      mfr == "R" ~ "Ralston Purina",
      TRUE ~ mfr
    ),
    shelf = case_when(
      shelf == 1 ~ "bottom-shelf",
      shelf == 2 ~ "middle-shelf",
      shelf == 3 ~ "top-shelf",
      TRUE ~ as.character(shelf)
    )
  )
head(UScereal)
```

## Graph  the relationship between calories and fat (2P)
Visualize the relationship of calories with fat. Additionally, highlight whether the product has been enriched with vitamins. 
<!-- Use appropriate titles and legends. -->

```{r}
p3 <- ggplot(UScereal, aes(x = calories, y = fat, color = o)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Calories and Fat in Cereal Products",
    x = "Calories",
    y = "Fat content",
    color = "Vitamin Enrichment"
  )
p3
```

## Graph the information for different shelves (2P)

As an extension to the previous plot, create plots differentiating between shelves.

```{r}
p3 + facet_wrap(~shelf) + 
     labs(subtitle = "Seperated by selfs")
```

## Graph  the relationship between sugar and fat (2P)

Visualize the relationship of sugar and fat. Additionally, highlight whether the product has been enriched with vitamins. Also show the calories. 
<!-- Use appropriate titles and legends. -->

```{r}
p4 <- ggplot(UScereal, aes(x = sugars, y = fat, color = vitamins, size = calories)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Calories and Fat in Cereal Products",
    x = "Sugars",
    y = "Fat content",
    color = "Vitamin Enrichment"
  )
p4
```


## Graph  the information separately for each manufacturer (2P)

As a first extension to the previous plot, show the information separately for each manufacturer, using facets. 

```{r}
p4 + facet_wrap(~mfr)
```
